Welcome to Locally Optimistic -- a blog for current and aspiring data analytics leaders. Started in NYC in early 2018 as an outgrowth of a slack channel / extremely informal meetup group, we hope to share our thoughts / opinions / experiences / trials / tribulations with others in the community.

If you have content that you would like to contribute (or if you just want to chat about data stuff), please reach out.

Quick note: The views and opinions expressed on this blog are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers
