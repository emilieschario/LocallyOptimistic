Data analysts at early stage, tech-adjacent, start ups have the coolest jobs. For junior and mid level folks especially, there's so much to learn (hopefully an exciting proposition!) and being an analyst is a great way to do that because you're forced to wear many different hats. In addition, there are numerous career paths to take once you've cut your teeth for a few years as an analyst. Being an analyst however could mean different things to different people. 

Folks outside of Data sometimes struggle with answering the question: "what does Data do here?". While folks can reason around "analysis" and "reporting" and "insights", their understanding is usually surface level -- which is okay! I've found it helpful to explain to folks what the Analytics team does in terms of other job functions they might be more familiar with.

At early stage companies, I've seen data analysts perform the jobs of:
<li>Business Analysts
<li>Engineers
<li>Product Managers
<li>Data Analysts / Scientists

To be sure, analysts don't perform these roles in equal parts all the time. Some weeks they write data transformations (Eng), other weeks they coordinate cross-functionally (PM) and yet other weeks they perform pure analysis (BA or DA). But on the whole, analyst's on data teams with fewer than 5 people and a company size of 50-150 will spend much of their time juggling each of the above jobs.

Outlining the types of work a data analyst might perform can help non-data folks understand what their Analytics team does and how to better partner together. And it helps to communicate why data analysis is a cool job! 

### Business Analysts

The best analysis is informed by domain expertise. Business analysts typically sit directly on product, sales or operations teams and understand their stakeholders' problems very well. The context gained by sitting together and close partnership helps hone their intuitions and enrich their analysis. Analysts will:
<li>Identify which business problems matter and which don't.
<li>Understand how to quickly home in on the highest pain points, and know what's possible to fix and what isn't. This skill is underestimated -- these folks are less likely to propose solutions that are out of sync with business reality.
<li>Gain trust of their stakeholders, helping improve communication cross functionally and reduce coordination costs.

Business analysts are helpful in ensuring that operations teams aren't always heads down, focused on executing; they can help folks step back and improve processes and exploit areas of opportunity. Management tends to appreciate this skill.

The flip side of spending too much time operating as business analyst is that, as we'll see below, a good data analyst build models, performs experiments, works cross functionally and occasionally spikes on projects -- tasks which all require time. Business analysts operate on their business team's schedule, which often requires quick turn around and answers to very specific questions. A business analyst might answer question such as "why did sales drop last week?" (very important in its own right!) whereas a data analyst might be working on a question such as "what is the single biggest driver within our control to increase sales?". The latter type of question could require weeks of work; the former perhaps a few hours. 

Signs that you may be spending too much time as a business analyst: constantly putting out fires for the same stakeholder, spending more time in Excel and less in SQL and in general working on short term projects with urgent deadlines, never sinking your teeth into anything. 

### Engineers

Analysts should be able to write efficient SQL, have a passing understanding of the codebase language (Python, ruby, etc...), and basic software engineering best practices such as version control (e.g. git), code review, testing and logging errors. Modern Analytics teams will also likely work in an [agile environment](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/agile-analytics-p1), compared to traditional BI teams. 

Analysts will also need to understand data modeling and how their data warehouse works (something even many engineers will have little experience with). A very common, fundamental, and recurring task for a data analyst is to write transformations that take in application or third party data and transform it according to business logic.  This is crucial work that is usually abstracted out from business teams, but is assumed to happen. If someone wants to know "how many new users, coming from Facebook, in the past 90 days have completed steps A and B and then converted?", an analyst will usually be the one writing that transformation logic. At least for early stage companies. 

Data transformations used to be the domain of the [Data engineer](https://blog.getdbt.com/does-my-startup-data-team-need-a-data-engineer-/) or BI developer, and in larger organizations it still is, though tech companies are more likely to hire an [Analytics Engineer](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/) to do this work. But until an organization gets large enough to break out the Analytics team into specialists, data analysts will be performing these tasks. All for the better, since they are closer to the business (recall the Business Analyst) and can use their improved intuition and context to know the best transformations to write.

The downside of too much engineering is less time performing analysis. Writing code and perfecting software engineering practices is great, but should be balanced against stepping back and thinking holistically about the business problem -- something Engineers aren't required to do as much. Analyst should be wary of spending too much time in the code and not enough time understanding their core stakeholders' problems.


### Product/Project Manager

Until the Data team gets larger, analysts must manage their workloads, scope projects, break up Epics into smaller tasks, prioritize and communicate with stakeholders. Analysts likely work in a matrix or pseudo-matrix organization, reporting to a Data lead but with dotted lines to the business. Even on a centralized Data team, there are likely several non-Data teams that use the result of the work produced by the analyst to make decisions. This means analysts need to balance competing priorities, communicate cross functionally, set expectations, and meet with stakeholders on a constant basis. Engineers have Product Managers who can help with all of these tasks, allowing them to focus purely on the code and architecture. 

Some of this kind of work may be done by Analytics Managers, but a lot will still fall on the analyst's shoulders. PMing their own work does force analysts to build up that muscle which will make their overall work product better in the end. As a result of working closer with stakeholders, their work product will already be of higher value, all else equal, than had they begun working on something that no one asked for.

Having said that, project managing your own workflow can add a lot of administrative overhead. This means more meetings, documentation and emails, all of which take away from the core job of an analyst -- analyzing! 

### Data Analyst

Analysis is many things. A non-exhaustive list of activities that are particular to data analysis includes:

<li>Exploring data and making some charts
<li>Thinking about problems and experimenting with different models
<li>Going down rabbit holes, and realizing 2 days were wasted going down that rabbit hole
<li>Confidently providing recommendations and insights, usually with a polished presentation
<li>Testing and validating those recommendations

All of the above, and more, requires time and space to perform it, not dissimilar to what a researcher might do. Unlike researchers however, analysts need to ensure they are getting deliverables out the door. It's a fine balance to strike, which makes the job of an analyst all the more interesting.

To perform analysis well and efficiently presumes, among other things, that tools are built (engineering), problems are scoped well enough (project managing), and the analyst has enough domain knowledge (business analysis) to work on the right kinds of problems. Otherwise it really is just a research problem, which is why the analyst needs to have a strong working knowledge of all the above job functions.

### Where to next?

Part of what makes being a data analyst a cool job are the potential future career paths that you can take once you've cut your teeth for a few years in analytics. You can:
<li>Learn the domain and become a business or operational manager. You'll already be technically ahead of your peers, and upper management generally values data driven decision makers.
<li>If you skew more technical and statistical, the obvious path is to data science. In non-research roles, data scientists with strong business backgrounds almost always trump data scientists that are purely technical. Business-minded folks know where to look for the right problems, how to scope work appropriately, how to communicate with non-technical folks and how to tailor solutions to be complex or simple.  
<li>For operationally or strategically oriented analysts, there's also the path towards formal product management. This could be as a "data product manager" or a more traditional product manager. There's more work to do here to transition into a purely product role, but coming from an analytics background is a great start.
<li>You can remain in Data and move up into managerial, directorial and VP/executive level roles. These begin to encompass data science, data engineering and other data-adjacent functions in addition to analytics. These roles also skew strategic and managerial instead of technical.

There are certainly more paths one can take, but the above are the most common. As a general rule of thumb, it's easier to transition from more technical jobs to less technical, than vice versa, and working in analytics gives you a strong, technical start.
 
## Conclusion

The work performed by a data analyst spans many different job functions. Analysts need to juggle being technically sound, with being thoughtful business partners, with having strong project management skills and learning the domain of their business. The skills gained as an analyst will set folks up well to pursue various career paths should they choose to leave analytics. This makes being a data analyst a great choice as a career in tech!
