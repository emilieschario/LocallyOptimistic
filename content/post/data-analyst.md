Data analysts at early stage, tech-adjacent start ups have the coolest jobs. For junior and mid level folks especially, there’s so much to learn (hopefully an exciting proposition!)  as analysts  wear many different hats. In addition, there are numerous career paths to take once an analyst has cut their teeth for a few years. Due to its broad set of responsibilities, an analyst’s job can be esoteric and often means different things to different people.

Folks outside of Data sometimes struggle with answering the question, “What does Data do here?” Folks can reason around “analysis”, “reporting” and “insights”, but otherwise their understanding is usually surface level. I’ve found it helpful to explain what the Analytics team does in terms of other job functions with which they might be more familiar.

<!--more-->

On Data teams of fewer than 5 people and company size roughly 50-150, data analysts perform the job responsibilities of:
<li>Business Analysts
<li>Engineers
<li>Product Managers
<li>Data Analysts / Scientists

To be sure, analysts don’t perform these roles in equal parts all the time. Some weeks they write data transformations (Eng), other weeks they coordinate cross-functionally (PM), and yet other weeks they perform pure analysis (BA or DA). But on the whole, analysts will spend much of their time juggling these responsibilities.

Outlining the types of work a data analyst might perform can help non-data folks understand what their Data team does and how to better partner together. And it helps to communicate why data analysis is such a unique job!

## Business Analyst

The best analysis is informed by domain expertise. Business analysts typically sit directly on product, sales or operations teams and thoroughly understand their stakeholders’ problems. The context gained by these close partnerships help hone their intuition and enrich their analysis. In this capacity, analysts are able to:
<li>Identify which business problems matter and which don’t.
<li>Understand what’s feasible to fix. This skill can be underestimated – analysts are less likely to propose solutions that are out of sync with business reality.
<li>Gain trust of their stakeholders, helping improve communication cross-functionally and reduce coordination costs.

Business analysts ensure that operations teams aren’t singularly focused on executing. They are instrumental in helping teams step back and improve processes in order to  exploit areas of opportunity. While data analyst responsibilities often overlap with those of a business analyst, a good data analyst also build models, performs experiments, works cross functionally and occasionally spikes on more technical projects – tasks which all require time. Business analysts, however, operate on their business team’s schedule, requiring quick turn around and answers to very specific questions. A business analyst might answer the question,  “Why did sales drop last week?”, whereas a data analyst works  on a question like, “What is the single biggest driver within our control to increase sales?” The latter type of question could require weeks of work; the former perhaps a few hours.

Signs that a data analyst may be spending too much time as a business analyst include constantly putting out fires for the same stakeholder, spending more time in Excel and less in SQL, and in general working on short term projects with urgent deadlines. 

## Engineer

Data analysts write efficient SQL, have an understanding of the codebase language (Python, Ruby, etc…), and basic software engineering best practices such as version control (e.g. git), code review, testing and logging errors. Modern Analytics teams will also likely work in an [agile environment](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/agile-analytics-p1), as will the Engineering teams.

Data transformations - transformations that take in application or third party data and transform it according to business logic - used to be the domain of the [Data engineer](https://blog.getdbt.com/does-my-startup-data-team-need-a-data-engineer-/), and in larger organizations it still is, though tech companies are more likely to hire an [Analytics Engineer](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/) to do this work. But until an organization gets large enough to specialize the Analytics team, data analysts perform these tasks. If someone wants to know, “How many new users coming from Facebook in the past 90 days have completed steps A and B and then converted?”, an analyst will write that transformation logic. All for the better, since they are closer to the business and can use their improved intuition and context to write the best transformations. Analysts also need to understand data modeling and how their data warehouse works - something with which even many engineers will have little experience. 

Data analysts who spend time writing code and perfecting software engineering practices must balance these responsibilities against stepping back and thinking holistically about the business problem. Analysts are better equipped to write quality code only if they are spending enough time understanding their core stakeholders’ problems.

## Product/Project Manager

Data analysts likely work in a [matrix or pseudo-matrix organization](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-the-most-effective-way-to-structure-a-data-science-team-498041b88dae), reporting to a Data lead but with dotted lines to the business. Even on a centralized Data team, there are likely several non-Data teams that use the result of the work produced by the analyst to make decisions. This means that data analysts need to manage their own workloads, scope their projects, balance competing priorities, communicate cross-functionally to set expectations, and meet with stakeholders consistently. Engineers usually have Product Managers who can help with all of these tasks, allowing them to focus purely on the code and architecture.

Project management skills improve the quality of work produced by data analysts, as does constant communication directly with stakeholders. But these responsibilities can also add a lot of administrative overhead -- more meetings, documentation and emails, all of which take away from the core job of an analyst – analyzing!

## Data Analyst

The core function of a data analyst - analysis - consists of many things. A non-exhaustive list includes:
<li>Exploring data and making charts
<li>Thinking about problems and experimenting with different models
<li>Going down rabbit holes, and realizing 2 days were wasted going down rabbit holes
<li>Confidently providing recommendations and insights, usually with a polished presentation
<li>Testing and validating those recommendations

These exploratory tasks require time and space to think critically and creatively, not dissimilar to the work of a researcher. Unlike researchers however, analysts need to ensure they are getting deliverables out the door. It’s a fine balance to strike, which makes the job of an analyst all the more interesting.

To perform analysis well and efficiently presumes that tools are built (engineering), problems are scoped (project management), and domain knowledge has been acquired (business analysis). A strong working knowledge of all the above job functions allows a Data Analyst to become more than a researcher, providing well-designed and tested insights and recommendations to the rest of the organization.

## Where to next?

Part of what makes being a data analyst a cool job are the potential future career paths. An experienced Data Analyst can move on to:
<li>Learn the domain and become a business or operational manager. You’ll already be technically ahead of your peers, and upper management generally values data driven decision makers.
<li>Become a data scientist, if you skew more technical and statistical. In non-research roles, data scientists with strong business backgrounds almost always trump data scientists that are purely technical. Business-minded folks know where to look for the right problems, how to scope work appropriately, how to communicate with non-technical folks and how to tailor solutions to be complex or simple.
<li>Join product management, for operationally or strategically oriented analysts. This could be as a “data product manager” or a more traditional product manager. There’s more work to do here to transition into a purely product role, but coming from an analytics background is a great start.
<li>Remain in Data and move up into managerial, directorial and VP/executive level roles. These begin to encompass data science, data engineering and other data-adjacent functions in addition to analytics. These roles also skew strategic and managerial instead of technical.

There are certainly more paths one can take, but the above are the most common. As a general rule of thumb, it’s easier to transition from more technical jobs to less technical, than vice versa, and working in analytics gives you a strong, technical start.

## Conclusion

The work performed by a data analyst spans many different job functions. Analysts need to juggle being technically sound with being thoughtful business partners with having strong project management skills and learning the domain of their business. The skills gained as an analyst will set folks up well to pursue various career paths should they choose to leave analytics. This makes being a data analyst a great choice as a career in tech!
