Data analysts at early stage, tech-adjacent, start ups have the coolest jobs. For junior and mid level folks especially, there's so much to learn (hopefully an exciting proposition!) and being an analyst is a great way to do that because you're forced to wear many different hats. 

As a result, folks outside of Data sometimes struggle with answering the question: "what does Data do here?". People can reason around "analysis" and "reporting" and "insights", but their understanding is usually surface level -- which is okay! However, it can be helpful to explain to folks what their Analytics team does in terms of other job functions they might be more familiar with. I believe that's partly because unless your product is data related (e.g. ML as a service), data analysts are jack-of-all-trades working cross functionally to help other teams make data informed decisions. But what does that even mean?

<!--more-->

At early stage companies, I've seen data analysts perform the jobs of:
<li>Business Analysts
<li>Engineers
<li>Product Managers
<li>Data Analysts / Scientists

To be sure, analysts don't perform these roles in equal parts all the time. Instead some weeks they write transformations (Eng), other weeks they coordinate cross-functionally (PM) and yet other weeks they perform pure analysis (BA or DA). But on the whole, analyst's on data teams with fewer than 5 people and a company size of 50-150 will spend much of their time juggling each of the above jobs.

Outlining the types of work a data analyst might perform can help non-data folks understand what their analytics team does and how to better partner together. And it helps to communicate why data analysis is a cool job! 

### Business Analysts

The best analysis is informed by domain expertise. Business analysts typically sit directly on product, sales or operations teams and understand their stakeholders problems very well. The context gained by sitting together and close partnership helps hone their intuitions and enrich their analysis. Analysts will:
<li>Identify which business problems matter and which don't.
<li>Understand how to quickly home in on the highest pain points, and know what's possible to fix and what isn't. This skill underestimated -- these folks are less likely to propose solutions that are out of sync with business reality.
<li>Gain trust of their stakeholders, helping improve communication cross functionally and reduce coordination costs.

Business analysts are helpful in ensuring that operations teams aren't always heads down, focused on executing; they can help folks step back and improve processes and exploit areas of opportunity. Management tends to appreciate this skill.

### Engineers

Analysts should be able to write efficient SQL, have a passing understanding of the codebase language (Python, ruby, etc...), and basic software engineering best practices such as version control (e.g. git), code review, testing and logging errors. Modern Data teams will also likely work in an [agile environment](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/agile-analytics-p1), compared to traditional BI teams. 

They'll also need to understand data modeling and how their data warehouse works. Specifically, data analysts write transformations that take in application or third party data and transform it according to business logic.  This is crucial work that is usually abstracted out from business teams, but is assumed to happen. If someone wants to know "how many new users, coming from Facebook, in the past 90 days have completed steps A and B and then converted?", an analyst will usually be the one writing that transformation logic. At least for early stage companies. 

Data transformations used to be the domain of the [Data engineer](https://blog.getdbt.com/does-my-startup-data-team-need-a-data-engineer-/) or BI developer, and in larger organizations it still is, though tech companies are more likely to hire an [Analytics Engineer](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/) to do this work. But until an organization get large enough to break out the Analytics team into specialists, data analysts will be performing these tasks. All for the better, since they are closer to the business (recall the Business Analyst) and can use their improved intuition and context to know the best transformations to write.

### Product/Project Manager

Until the Data team gets larger, analysts must manage their workloads, scope projects, break up Epics into smaller tasks, prioritize and communicate with stakeholders. Analysts likely work in a matrix or pseudo-matrix organization, reporting to a Data lead but with dotted lines to the business. Even on a centralized Data team, there are likely several non-Data teams that use the result of the work produced by the analyst to make decisions. This means analysts need to balance competing priorities, communicate cross functionally, set expectations, and meet with stakeholders on a constant basis. Engineers have Product Managers who can help with all of these tasks, allowing them to focus purely on the code and architecture. 

Some of this kind of work may be done by Analytics Managers, but a lot will still fall on the analyst's shoulders. PMing their own work does force analysts' to build up that muscle which will make their overall work product better in the end. They'll be working within the context of stakeholders, biasing their work to be of higher importance, than if they simply did their own work without regard to external teams.

### Data Analyst

Finally, analysts must perform analysis! Analysis is largely composed of: 
<li>Exploring data and making some charts
<li>Thinking about problems and experimenting with different models
<li>Going down rabbit holes, and realizing 2 days were wasted going down that rabbit hole
<li>Confidently providing recommendations and insights, usually with a polished presentation
<li>Testing and validating those recommendations

All of the above, and more, requires time and space to perform it. Analysts aren't researchers, but they need some of the slack that a researcher might get. The three job functions previously mentioned operate under tighter timelines and with immediate deliverables. The analysis part of an analyst's job is different in kind for this very reason.

To perform analysis well and efficiently presumes, among other things, that tools are built (engineering), problems are scoped well enough (project managing), and the analyst has enough domain knowledge (business analysis) to work on the right kinds of problems. Else it really is just a research problem, which is why the analyst needs to have a strong working knowledge of all the above roles.

### Where to next?

The possible career paths for an analyst are among the most diverse for any role. After spending a few years as a data analyst, you can:
<li>Learn the domain and become a business or operational manager. You'll already be technically ahead of your peers, and upper management generally values data driven decision makers.
<li>If you skew more technical and statistical, the obvious path is to data science. In non-research roles, Data Scientists with strong business backgrounds almost always trump Data Scientists that are purely technical. Business-minded folks know where to look for the right problems, how to scope work appropriately, how to communicate with non-technical folks and how to tailor solutions to be complex or simple.  
<li>For operationally or strategically oriented analysts, there's also the path towards formal product management. This could be as a "data product manager" or a more traditional product manager. There's more work to do here to transition into a purely product role, but coming from an analytics background is a great start.
<li>You can remain in Data and move up into managerial, directorial and VP level roles. These begin to encompass data science, data engineering and other functions in addition to analytics. These roles also skew strategic instead of technical.

There are certainly more paths one can take, but the above are the most common.
 
## Conclusion

For technically minded folks who aren't interested in the software engineering path, but aren't quite sure they want to go full out machine learning or data science, working a few years as a data analyst is a great way to learn various elements of a business, in various roles with a lot of upside opportunity for the future!
